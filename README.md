## Abstract:
Many aspects of neural physiology, including processes that underlie learning (e.g. neurotransmitter

release and long-lasting changes in synaptic strength), are regulated by brief and local changes in [Î¼m]

levels of free intracellular Ca 2+ . On this scale, changes in [Ca 2+ ] are known to activate many Ca 2+ -

sensors, including the Ca 2+ /calmodulin-dependent kinases (CaMKs). Although CaMK4 is known to

function in long-term memory and its paralog, CaMK1, in nervous system development, there is no

evidence indicating that they function in learning acquisition. Here we reveal that the C. elegans

ortholog of CaMK1/4, CMK-1, regulates responses to mechanical

stimuli and learning, specifically tap habituation. From catalytic site analysis of the human and C.

elegans CaMKs, we predicted potential CaMK phosphorylation targets and, through mutation studies,

identified one of these, O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) transferase, OGT-1, as also being

necessary for wild-type responses to mechanical stimuli and learning. Detailed behavioral analysis of

single and double mutants suggests that CMK-1 and OGT-1 function in parallel pathways that may

converge on a common substrate to modulate the tap response. Our results provide the first evidence of

a role for CaMK and O-GlcNAc post-translational modification in responding to mechanical stimuli

and learning, which are fundamental biological processes present in all animals.
